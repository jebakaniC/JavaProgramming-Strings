The Fishing Club conducted a fishing competition on a big lake. The participants allowed for this competition should be 18 years and older. 
The participants should catch the fishes and give them to the referee so that he will add the count of the fishes based on their size. 
Then at the end of the day based on the count, points will be awarded. Help them by developing an application to convert the count into points in Java.
